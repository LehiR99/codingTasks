Task Manager Application
Description
This project implements a Task Manager application in Python, designed to help users organize and manage their tasks efficiently. It provides functionalities to add, remove, list tasks, mark tasks as completed, and persist tasks using a file-based data storage approach. The application aims to improve productivity by enabling users to keep track of their tasks and deadlines effectively.

Learning to implement a Task Manager application is important as it reinforces fundamental concepts such as object-oriented programming, file handling, data persistence, and basic user interaction through a command-line interface. These skills are crucial for developing practical, real-world applications where task management and data organization are key requirements.

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager.git
Navigate into the project directory:


cd task-manager
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
